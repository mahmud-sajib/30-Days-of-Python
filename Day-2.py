# Day 2: Strings, Variables, and Getting Input from Users

#1. Ask the user for their name and age, assign theses values to two variables, and then print them.
name = input("Please enter your name: ")
print(name)

age = input("Please enter your age: ")
print(age)

#2. Investigate what happens when you try to assign a value to a variable that youâ€™ve already defined. Try printing the variable before and after you reuse the name.
country = "Oman"
print(country)
country = "Syria"
print(country)

#3. Debug & fix the errors
hourly_wage = input("Please enter your hourly wage: ")
print("Hourly wage: ")
print(hourly_wage)

hours_worked = input("How many hours did you work this week? ")
print("Hours worked: ")
print(hours_worked)
